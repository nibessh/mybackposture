Write the Lewis structure for each ion. Include resonancestructures if necessary and assign formal charges to all atoms. Ifnecessary, expand the octet on the central atom to lower formalcharge.a. PO43- b. CN- c. SO32- d.Oct 10, 2019 · Rules for drawing Lewis structures. Goal: Given a chemical formula corresponding to a molecule or molecular ion, draw a Lewis structure. 1. First of all, a correct count of all valence electrons is essential. One way to do this is to write the Lewis symbols for all of the atoms in the formula, and count up all the "dots". Since oxygen is more electronegative then nitrogen, the negative charge is more stable when its on the oxygen atom. Therefore, structure #1 is more stable (preferred) than structure #2. Structures #3-#5 are even less stable. They either violate the octet rule (#4, #5) and / or have charges (sometimes multiple) on more than one atom (#3-#5).

The lewis structure of SF4 contains 13 lone pairs and 4 bonding pairs. It should be noted that, in lewis’s structure, the lone pairs are represented as dots and bond pairs are as single, double, or triple bonds. So, in the SF4 lewis structure, there are 4 ... Since oxygen is more electronegative then nitrogen, the negative charge is more stable when its on the oxygen atom. Therefore, structure #1 is more stable (preferred) than structure #2.
