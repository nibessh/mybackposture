Great Valley Museum of Natural History, Modesto.Oct 2020. We took our twin 5 year-olds to this exhibit on 10/17/20 and we walked through the entire exhibit in 20 minutes. The dig site was not open, and there were no age appropriate interactive activities other than posing for photos. For $12 a piece, this was extremely expensive and very disappointing. Highly NOT recommended. </p><br/><ul class="links"></ul></div></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup><script data-cfasync="false" src="../cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script>
