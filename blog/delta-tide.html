In a delta where tides are the dominant geomorphologic agent, tidal energy is the principal mechanism for the delivery of sediment to the coast away from the main river mouth. The ebb and flow of strong tidal currents causes shoals and bars to form parallel to the flow direction in the river mouth. Once these bed features emerge above the water ...Sacramento Delta (Tides) [ Alternate Link] Oct 10 2023 at 6:14 AM PDT: Oct 11 2023 at 9:00 AM PDT ** NOTE 1 ** The Klamath and North Coast river guidance points are included in the North Coast Forecast Group. ** NOTE 2 ** The Feather Yuba and American river guidance points are included in the Lower Sacramento River Forecast Group.

A tidal delta is the sand bar or shoaling area left at the mouth of a river by the movement of bottom mud and sand by a diurnal tide and the currents that result from that tide.  Tide-dominated deltas usually form in areas with a large tidal range, or area between high tide and low tide.

The massive Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, in India and Bangladesh, is a tide-dominated delta, shaped by the rise and fall of tides in the Bay of Bengal. Gilbert deltas are formed as rivers deposit large, coarse sediments. Salinity in deltaic systems is expected to increase in the near future due to sea level rise. This will cause severe environmental consequences because salinity can be detrimental to agriculture, aquaculture and human consumption. Tidal dynamics are important in regulating salinity in river deltas. However, there is still uncertainty about the influence of different tidal amplitudes on deltas ...But people living on the soft, compressible sediments of river deltas have another factor to contend with: sinking land.
