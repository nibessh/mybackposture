I‚Äôm 13 dpo right now , since Sunday I have had very sore breasts, been crampy, felt sick to my stomach a few times over the last few days. Has anyone tested at 13dpo and had a BFP after that?9DPO=BFN, 10DPO=BFN, 11DPO=BFN... 12DPO=BFP! I had a super light (had to squint hard to see it) positive at 9dpo, then a positive on a digital at 10dpo. I tested at 9 and got a negative. Then again at 11 and got a very very faint two lines but I thought it was a negative. Then again at 13 DPO and got a positive.  Therefore, the 13 DPO BFN may not actually be a bad thing. What‚Äôs happening in my body at 13dpo? One of three things will typically be taking place in your ‚Ä¶Sperm can survive in your body for a maximum of five days, so if you've had sex up to five days before your ovulated, or within 24 hours after, then there is a chance that the sperm have reached the egg and fertilised it. If the egg reaches your womb without being fertilised, then it will leave your body when your next period happens.Resulted in a positive test taken at 10 DPO, with a sharp implantation dip at 9 DPO. Bottom is my current chart. My temps are noticeably lower and I'm not feeling confident it has accurately pinpointed my O date with all those negative OPKs. CD 20 was my darkest but not a true positive. I take OPKs 2x a day.A positive test at 10 days post-ovulation has a good chance of being a false positive. You may either get your period a week later, test negative, or have a chemical pregnancy, which is when the egg is fertilized but is unable to implant or grow. This will lead to an early miscarriage, and it can definitely be disappointing.  If you get a 13 DPO BFN (a negative pregnancy test result), it‚Äôs a good idea to take the test again in four or five days, or take a blood test in a health care provider‚Äôs office. Pregnancy tests rely on hCG levels, which rise only after implantation.13 dpo temp still normal high this morning.
