Hence the function defined by z = ef ( z) − f(z) − 20 should pass f(0) ≈ π. So with the Lagrange Inversion Theorem, we can find a series representation for f(z). If there's any special reason why f(0) ≈ π, it would explain why eπ − π ≈ 20.It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!”. 13 Moses answered the people, “Do not be afraid.
