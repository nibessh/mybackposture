Includes color-coding for mobs to be interrupted, color-coding for frontal abilities, color-coding for aggro, as well as shortened …I use plater and made it so nothing ever goes transparent and nameplates stack which took about a minute to find and check boxes for, has made tanking a lot better. Looking forward to trying OP’s WA as plater does change color when someone gets close but sometimes that isn’t good enough. Haven’t tried threatplates.P.S. If you are looking for my WoW Classic Plater, it's here.It's the same look as my Dragonflight Plater profile below. The below Dragonflight Season 3 Plater nameplates profile is entirely FREE to use (also backwards compatible with Season 1 and Season 2 dungeons, so feel free to update before Season 2 ends). </p><br/><ul class="links"></ul></div></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup>
