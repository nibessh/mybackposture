Can‚Äôt remember the name saw it just a few days ago. It‚Äôs like the Hercule Hercule or I Never Knew This World Existed super souls. It gives you 5% defense boost for every ally that gets KO‚Äôd or revived I can‚Äôt remember the wordage. In the end it stacks 10 tens giving you a 50% in defense.It works with all Charged Ki Blasts, but only Charged Ki Blasts, not regular ones. The Frieza Race‚Äôs Golden Form transformation gives the easiest one to use it with.
