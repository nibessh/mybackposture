DesignAn energy pyramid’s upward shape shows how the amount of useful energy that enters each level- chemical level in the form of food, decreases as it is used by the organism in that level. In other words, Energy decreases as one moves through the trophic levels from bottom to the top of the pyramid. Thus, the energy pyramid is always upward.  About Transcript The trophic pyramid illustrates energy transfer within ecosystems, highlighting primary producers, consumers, and decomposers. Energy from the sun is stored as biomass, with only 10% transferred between trophic levels.A trophic pyramid exemplifies feeding levels within an ecosystem. Figure 13.2. Trophic pyramid. There are three major categories of living organisms in an ecosystem and each has a special role: producers (plants), consumers (animals), and decomposers (and detritus feeders). carnivores (larger animals, i.e. tuna, sharks, birds, sea mammals, etc.)  Energy Flow. Light energy from the sun is converted to chemical energy by plants through the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis produces oxygen for all organisms and a source of food for herbivores. The herbivores (primary consumers) are then consumed by secondary consumers, secondary consumers are then consumed by tertiary consumers.Photosynthesis occurs through a process involving sunlight, carbon dioxide and water. The tropical rain forest hosts more than 50 percent all the animal and plant species in the world. Some forest producers in this area include trees, algae and rattan.
