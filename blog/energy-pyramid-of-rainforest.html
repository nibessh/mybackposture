During the process of energy flow in the ecosystem, plants being the producers absorb sunlight with the help of the chloroplasts and a part of it is transformed into chemical energy in the process of photosynthesis. This energy is stored in various organic products in the plants and ...  The energy pyramid shows how the stored energy in each organism, and then the energy is transferred to the other organisms, by them consuming each other.(Buckley, J. M., Jr.). The reason why energy transfer is not 100 percent is because during this process energy is lost on each step. The energy that is lost is transferred into heat.Rainforest Energy Pyramid First Trophic Level or Producers. Algae on the branches of the tree. It is the lowest trophic level occupied by the...
