This mod is a visual overhaul of our beloved vampire Serana, with a fierce and scary vampire look (total Vanilla friendly), with four new options for makeup. Designed for my story "A Skyrim's Tale" and shared here for everyone in the community. Share. Requirements.Despite of all these things, let's enjoy the mod! From v2.0 and SE the mod is finally Lore-Friendly. You have to play the mod 'till the end and you'll see yourself. * TECHNICAL INFOS *. …Andromeda - Standing Stones of Skyrim. Features. Andromeda replaces the vanilla Standing Stone effects with two new abilities per stone. The new abilities are designed to encourage new character builds. Discover all Standing Stones to also unlock a new power for each stone. High quality scripting and art. </p><br/><ul class="links"></ul></div></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup>
