That’s because it has a 310A ampacity. You can make a similar calculation for 50 feet (10% addition), 150 feet (30% addition), and 200 feet (40% addition), and choose the corresponding KCMIL wire.  The ground wire size for 70 amp is 4AWG. You can use the same gauge for the hot, neutral, and ground wires. The ground wire is a defensive component that directs the current to the earth when a malfunction occurs. You can also use a larger ground wire than all the other wires because it has less resistance. A 100 A sub-panel requires a two-pole 100 A breaker - if you want 100 A. You can use #4 AWG 75 deg C or 90 Deg C copper wire in conduit for a 100 A breaker provided the breaker is labeled for use with 75 deg C wire. A #8 copper ground is adequate for a 100 A feeder If running NM cable or SE cable, you would need #2 copper, I believe.  After all, 80 amps aren’t really listed in the NEC wire size chart.

Based on "6 space panel" and no mention of on-demand electric water heating (don't, just don't) or of EV charging, I can't imagine you really expect to use anything close to 100A peak/80A continuous. If you do, then jump up to 1 AWG Aluminum.  How a Subpanel Is Connected. When an electrician installs a subpanel, the usual process is to first run a feeder cable from the main panel to the subpanel. This is typically a three-wire cable with three insulated conductors plus a bare copper ground wire. The cable must have a wire gauge sufficient to the amperage of the subpanel—a 100 …Copper wire is second only to silver in terms of electric conductivity. Copper has a better electrical load carrying capacity, needing less insulation and a smaller wire gauge. For the same conductivity, copper wiring is about half the size of aluminum wiring. Corrosion Resistant. Copper is a corrosion-resistant metal.Wire Size Calculator. Enter the information below to calculate the appropriate wire size. Voltage - Enter the voltage at the source of the circuit. Single-phase voltages are usually 115V or 120V, while three-phase voltages are typically 208V, 230V or 480V. Amperes - Enter the maximum current in amps that will flow through the circuit. When choosing the wire for a 100 amp subpanel, you need to make sure that the wire gorge is sufficient for the amperage of the sub panel. Generally, a 100 amp sub panel …  I agree with Greg you can put in any size sub panel. Other than the panel size having to be the same or larger than the feeder breaker, the limiting factor is the wire size feeding the panel that is what sets the feeder breaker you can feed a 100 amp panel from a 10awg wire with a 30 amp breaker. I have done just this.And, you round up to the next available breaker size. That means usually: 100A is #3 copper ($600/100ft) or #1 aluminum ($175/100ft). 125A is #1 copper or #1/0 aluminum ( you need to call it 120A feeder, but you get to round up to 125A breaker since 120A is not made.) If you need full declared 125A you'd need 2/0 aluminum.Oct 4, 2022 · 2. AWG. The American Wire Gauge (AWG) is the dominant sizing system for wires in the US. The sizes help electrical professionals determine the right application for different wire sizes. AWG is also responsible for providing the ampacity of different wire sizes.

Single-phase voltages are usually 115V or 120V, while three-phase voltages are typically 208V, 230V or 480V. Amperes - Enter the maximum current in amps that will flow through the circuit. For motors, it is recommended to multiply the nameplate FLA by 1.25 for wire sizing.Oct 2, 2023 · The same goes for longer distances. They’re fairly straightforward to calculate since we’re using 100A as the adjusted wire size for 80 amp breaker. 100A x 140% = 140A. 100A x 160% = 160A. Confirm the wire recommendations by referring to Table 310.16 of the NEC. The size of the fuse or breaker is dictated by the size of the wire as follows: 1.) 14 gauge wire = 15 amp 2.) 12 gauge wire = 20 amp 3.) 10 gauge wire = 30 amp. 14 gauge wire is normally the smallest wire that you will find in the service panel. 12 gauge is a little thicker than 14 gauge, and 10 gauge is thicker than the 12 gauge, and is ...  Sometimes you need to size a single phase transformer or three-phase transformer, and the KVA rating is the only parameter. With simple equations, you can determine the correct transformer size. (Read 100 Amp Sub Panel Wire Size Guide) This equation is the basic transformer formula applied in sing-phase designs: Volts x Amps / …What size wire do I need for a 80 amp sub panel? To install an 80 amp sub panel, you need to know how to run the wires from the main service panel to the subpanel. Typically, the subpanel requires three wires: two hot, one neutral, and one ground. You can purchase three-wire cable, or SEO cable, at a local electrical supply store or online. HH = high-heat resistant insulation to 194°F. N = Nylon-coated wire insulation, resistant to damage by exposure to petroleum chemicals, oil, gasoline, wire may be marked "NYLON". NM = non-metallic insulated wire or cable. NM-B = non-metallic type B electrical cable, has greater heat resistance than straight NM cable.The minimum wire size for a 100 amp sub panel is 4 AWG copper or 2 AWG aluminum. It is based on the 83% rule, which defines that the wire size should handle 83% of the amperage of the sub-panel. In these conditions, 83% of 100 amps is 83 amps, so the wire size can handle at least 83 amps.  Beyond the AWG sizes are the MCM sizes, which start at 250 and go up to 2,000. About the largest pump cable you will ever see in water well applications is 500 MCM. We are talking heavy cable — more than five pounds per foot for three conductors. For residential water well work, most pump cable sits in the #6 to #14 AWG range.NEC 310-16 Code. This determines what size wire for 30 amp service at a distance. Usually, you have to add 20% to the wire’s ampacity for every 100 feet away from sub panel. The first step in checking what size wire you need for a 30 amp circuit is to look at the AWG wire size chart here. You check the wire sizes with 30 or more ampacity.To feed a 100amp sub panel that is 200 feet away, you will need at least a 1 AWG copper wire or simply #3 copper wire. Alternatively, you can use 2/0 aluminum wires. These two wire sizes are enough to carry 100 amp throughout that distance. 6ga is pretty much the standard for panel grounding up to 200a.
