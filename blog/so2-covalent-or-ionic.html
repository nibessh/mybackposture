Based on lewis structures, the octet rule seems to work for silicon dioxide so shouldn't it also be an ionic bond? bond ShareCorrect the following statement: “The bonds in solid PbCl 2 are ionic; the bond in a HCl molecule is covalent. Thus, all of the valence electrons in PbCl 2 are located on the Cl – ions, and all of the valence electrons in a HCl molecule are shared between the H and Cl atoms.”Unlike ionic compounds, the subscripts for covalent compounds are never reduced. For example, a molecule of hydrogen peroxide contains two oxygen atoms and two hydrogen atoms. This means the formula is H 2 O 2 . it would be incorrect to reduce it to HO since this would imply that the molecule contains only one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom.1 Answers.
