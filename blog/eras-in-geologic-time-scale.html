Now that you have learned about the hierarchical components of the geological time scale--eons, eras, periods, and epochs--consider again how all of these parts fit together. Note that some boundaries (those that follow horizontal lines on the time scale) are equivalent in age.Geologic Time Scale. Today, the geologic time scale is divided into major chunks of time called eons. Eons may be further divided into smaller chunks called eras, and each era is divided into periods. Figure 12.1 shows you what the geologic time scale looks like. We now live in the Phanerozoic eon, the Cenozoic era, and the Quarternary period. Geologic Time Scale. Another tool for understanding the history of Earth and its life is the geologic time scale. You can see this time scale in Figure below. It divides Earth’s history into eons, eras, and periods. These divisions are based on major changes in geology, climate, and the evolution of life.The Geologic Time Scale. The geologic time scale. Image by Jonathan R. Hendricks for the Earth@Home project. Note that the geologic time scale above is not scaled to time and mostly represents the Phanerozoic Eon. Mosts of geologic history (88%) happened during the Precambrian, which is represented by Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic eons.The Precambrian Time Span is the earliest time period on the Geologic Time Scale. It stretches from the formation of the earth 4.6 billion years ago to around 600 million years ago and encompasses many Eons and Eras leading up to the Cambrian Period in the current Eon.  Geologists have mapped out a time scale that is a “calendar” of Earth’s geologic history. The scale of geologic time starts some 4 billion years ago, when Earth’s crust was formed.

The scale divides all geologic time into a series of named intervals or units according to the order in which rocks and fossils were formed. From longest to shortest in relative length, those units are eons, eras, periods, and epochs. The Earth is about 4.5 billion years old. The geological time scale divides up this vast time interval. This scale is most detailed for the time in which life was abundant, as shown by fossils. Geological Timescale The oldest fossils are between 3 billion and 3.5 billion years old. These are fossil bacteria, and forGeologic Time Scale. Today, the geologic time scale is divided into major chunks of time called eons.
