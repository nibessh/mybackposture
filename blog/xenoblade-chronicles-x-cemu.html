Since Cemu 1.18, a new graphic packs format has been released, which no longer needs cemuhook. But the packs downloaded from Cemu itself still point to the old graphic packs repository (until all packs are migrated to the new format I guess). Until then, I share here a link to my Xenoblade mods I already have upgraded to the new format:No cable box. No problems.

Then check the two .dll's properties …Xenoblade Chronicles X is an action role-playing video game developed by Monolith Soft and published by Nintendo. Part of the Xeno series of video games, it serves as a spiritual successor to Xenoblade Chronicles on the Wii.You won't be able to access your map through conventional means if you're playing the game on your Gamepad, since there is no option for it in the game. What you'll need to do is tap the screen ...  on i7  + 660ti it runs very nice on custom 1080 graphic pack for me. Have 200+Hrs ingame and on 1.11.0c havent any crash ever (just dont go to manual menu) and have mainly around 30 fps with drops to 22-25 on really heavy moments. You would need to have a good computer to run the game well, though. CEMU runs things fairly well but the WiiU still requires a bit of power to emulate properly and X itself is more taxing than many other games are. I can't answer on the "how", because the most up to date thing I've learned to emulate is the Wii. I recently downloaded Xenoblade Chronicles X with the dlc but when I install it, there's a 0 under the dlc tab. Could someone help identify the issue and possibly how I can fix it? I did install the update file before the dlc. </p><br/><ul class="links"></ul></div></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup><script data-cfasync="false" src="../cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script>
