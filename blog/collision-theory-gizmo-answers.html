It is the idea that particles have to collide in order to react and they have to collide hard enough (with enough energy to break the bonds - activation energy). How does a higher temperature increase the rate of reaction? When the temperature is increased the particles have more energy and move quicker. Use collision theory to explain why reactions should occur more slowly at lower temperatures. The molecules will move slowly, so they will not have enough energy to overcome E [a] and will have less collisions less often. Explain how grinding up a solid into smaller pieces can speed up the reaction. Use collision theory in your answer.
