Irrational Numbers Symbol. Generally, we use the symbol “P” to represent an irrational number, since the set of real numbers is denoted by R and the set of rational numbers is denoted by Q. We can also represent irrational numbers using the set difference of the real minus rationals, in a way $\text{R} – \text{Q}$ or $\frac{R}{Q}$.There is no standard symbol for the set of irrational numbers. Perhaps one reason for this is because of the closure properties of the rational numbers. We introduced closure properties in Section 1.1, and the rational numbers \(\mathbb{Q}\) are closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by nonzero rational numbers.  Real numbers are numbers that we can place on a traditional number line. Examples of real numbers are 1, 1 2, − 6.3, and 1, 356.
