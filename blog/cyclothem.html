These strata are part of the biostratigraphically-defined early Pleistocene (1.1 -- 1.6 Ma) Bermont formation and were likely deposited during a 160 kyr interval between 1.3 and 1.1 Ma.  The Seelyville was correlated with a part of the Abingdon Cyclothem of western Illinois by Alexander (1943).

A typical Pennsylvanian cyclothem includes beds of nonmarine transitioning to marine sediments in the lower half of the cyclothem, with beds of marine transitioning to nonmarine sediments dominating the upper half of the cyclothem (Heckel, 1977). A transgressive-regressive sequence comprising a typical "Kansas" cyclothem consists of: 1.The "typical" Kansas-type cyclothem consists of the following lithologies, in ascending order, 1) a sandy to shaley "outside" shale of nearshore to nonmarine origin, possibly including a coal at the top, 2) a dense, dark "middle" transgressive limestone, 3) a black, fissile, sometimes phosphatic offshore "core" shale, and 4) aThe Mowry Shale (part of the Greenhorn Cyclothem) has been commercially mined for bentonite in Montana.

The long-standing difficulty of correlating Pennsylvanian strata among provincial faunal regions is resolved by effecting "digital" correlation of major glacial-eustatic cyclothems that represent high-stands when certain species achieved more global distribution than usual. In the late Moscovian-early Gzhelian (late Desmoinesian-early Virgilian) succession in the midcontinent United States ...In summary, Red Eagle cyclothem sedimentation is interpreted to have begun with the accumulation of redbeds in very shallow, turbid, warm, slightly hyperhaline water during the medial part of Johnson time. Deposition continued while the regional climate became cooler and more moist than when the redbeds were deposited.Nov 6, 2010 · Subsequent collections of crinoids show that the cold-water assemblages come from offshore deposits in the cyclothem, that is, "core" shales and adjacent parts of the limestone members, whereas the warm-water assemblages come from "outside" shales and upper parts of "upper" limestones, which are nearshore deposits (see Fig. 4 in preceding field ...  The increase in δ 13 C values in the Claggett cyclothem suggests a partial contribution from volcanic emanations to the 13 C/ 12 C ratio of the sea. Dissolution of Mg-rich volcanic debris from a major volcanic episode resulted in anomalously high Mg/Ca ratios in the sea and in the shells of molluscs living in the sea at that time.When and Where: Thursday, August 12 through Sunday, August 15, 1999..

The glacio-eustatic model of cyclothem de-velopment was first proposed by Wanless and Shepard ...Cyclothems are repetitious sequences that occur repeatedly in the Permo-Pennsylvanian (Absaroka). The classic cyclothem records a single advance and retreat of the sea in an area, giving rise to a symmetrical rock cycle of non-marine to marine to non-marine sediments; however, the ideal seldom occurs. Stacking lithofacies in the Domodedovo Formation of Peski quarries show prominent changes in paleodepth and depositional environment. Distribution in the section of fusulinoids, algae, conodonts, and macrofossils are revealed. Among the latter, brachiopods and bryozoans are discussed in most detail.Onset of marine conditions in a cyclothem is often marked by a widespread erosional or "ravinement" surface that scours the top of the coal bed and the GSW (Liu and Gastaldo, 1992).

Cyclothem Black shale The Late Pennsylvanian Midcontinent Sea (LPMS) of North America reached its greatest extent (~2.1×106 km2) during glacioeustatic highstands from the Middle Pennsylvanian to the Early Permian. At these times, the sea was strongly strati ed, with a subpycnoclinal layer that was anoxic and intermittently sul dic.  The cyclothem concept was based on the assumption of a single transgressive–regressive cycle formed by a facies framework with 10 rock units in coal-bearing strata (Fig. 3). The position of these units within the cyclothem was determined by the prevailing state of marine regression or transgression.
