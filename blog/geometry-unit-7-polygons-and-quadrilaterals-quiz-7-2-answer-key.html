The interior angle sum of any polygon can be found using the formula (n-2) * 180, where n is the number of sides of the polygon. In the case of an octagon, which has 8 sides, the formula becomes (8-2) * 180 = 6 * 180 = 1080 degrees. Therefore, the correct answer is 1080.

B. 70. Explanation. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. In this case, we are given three angles: 70, 25, and 80. To find the missing angle, we subtract the sum of these angles from 180. 70 + 25 + 80 = 175. Therefore, the missing angle is 180 - 175 = 5 degrees.Find step-by-step solutions and answers to Geometry ... Section 7-2: Similar Polygons. Section 7-3: Proving Triangles Similar.
