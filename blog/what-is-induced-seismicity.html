Despite the well-known result that b-value is negatively correlated with differential stress for natural earthquakes, there is no similar correlation for b-value variations because the differential stress is nearly constant for ... The basic principle of induced seismicity is that the pressure buildup caused by fluid injection reduces the effective stresses, which brings the stress state closer to failure (Fig. 1). If failure conditions are reached, the elastic energy stored in the rock mass is released and a (micro)seismic event is induced.In the Sichuan Basin, seismic activity has been low historically, but in the past few decades, a series of moderate to strong earthquakes have occurred.
