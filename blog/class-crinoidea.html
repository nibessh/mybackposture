The class Crinoidea is the ancestor group of all other echinoderm classes. The relationships among extant orders are still obscure, but some attempts have been made to elucidate them. Like their relatives—starfishes, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and brittle stars—crinoids are echinoderms, animals with rough, spiny surfaces and a special kind of radial symmetry based on five or multiples of five. Crinoids have lived in the world's oceans since at least the beginning of the Ordovician Period, roughly 485 million years ago.Feather stars are in the class Crinoidea, which is a group of echinoderms that includes sea lilies and feather stars.

Most crinoids, often referred to as 'sea lilies', are sessile creatures with calcified skeletons and sometimes stalks which attach to hard substrates. Some however, are known to be stemless and swim with help from their many arms.The topology from well-resolved trees of this early crinoid radiation indicates that the Crinoidea should be subdivided into six subclasses. A new subclass and new order, Aethocrinea and Aethocrinida, respectively, are proposed for crinoids with four circlets of plates in the aboral cup: lintels, infrabasals, basals, and radials.Class Crinoidea .

Crinoids are characterized by a mouth on the top surface that is surrounded by feeding arms. They have a U-shaped gut, and their anus is located next to the mouth.  Stalked crinoids, or "sea lilies", lived attached to the bottom, and filtered food particles from the currents flowing past them.

Major Subgroups of Crinoidea. As mentioned above, Moore &amp; Teichert (1978) recognized the four major lineages that they identified as subclasses (Camerata, Inadunata, Flexibilia, and Articulata), and they placed the single species of Echmatocrinus into its own subclass, as the primitive, basal crinoid.

Feather stars, or comatulids, are echinoderms that belong to the class Crinoidea (phylum Echinodermata) which they share with the sea lilies. Unlike the latter group, however, feather stars are not obliged to remain in one place; instead they can swim or even crawl over short distances before attaching themselves to some support.

As mentioned above, Moore &amp; Teichert (1978) recognized the four major lineages that they identified as subclasses (Camerata, Inadunata, Flexibilia, and Articulata), and they placed the single species of Echmatocrinus into its own subclass, as the primitive, basal crinoid.This category has the following 29 subcategories, out of 29 total. Crinoidea fossils ‎ (21 C, 257 F) Crinoidea illustrations ‎ (4 C, 23 F) Feather stars of South Africa ‎ (2 C) Paleontological publications and works relevant to Crinoidea ‎ (3 C) Predation on Crinoidea ‎ (2 F) Symbiosis with Crinoidea ‎ (2 C, 17 F) Crinoidea anatomy ...Figure 2. Different members of Echinodermata include the (a) sea star of class Asteroidea, (b) the brittle star of class Ophiuroidea, (c) the sea urchins of class Echinoidea, (d) the sea lilies belonging to class Crinoidea, and (d) sea cucumbers, representing class Holothuroidea. The meaning of CRINOIDEA is a large class of chiefly tropical or fossil echinoderms that have a more or less cup-shaped body provided with five or more feathery arms …Class Crinoidea. The sea lilies and feather stars reside within the class Crinoidea (from the Greek root word crino meaning lily). Sea lilies are sessile organisms attached to the substrate by a flexible stalk (Figs. 3.96 A and B). The digestive organs are in a bud at the top of the stalk called the calyx. The arms of the crinoid extend out ...  The Amphoracrinidae Bather, 1899 is redefined, and all genera of this family are diagnosed with objective characters. Dilatocrinus Webster and Lane, 1987 and Pimlicocrinus Wright, 1943 are transferred into the Amphoracrinidae. Type specimens that define Displodocrinus Webster and Lane, 1987 and Dilatocrinus Webster and Lane, 1987 are clarified. The …Crinoids are marine animals that make up the class Crinoidea. Crinoids that are attached to the sea bottom by a stalk in their juvenile form are commonly called sea lilies, while the unstalked forms, called feather stars or comatulids, are members of the largest crinoid order, Comatulida. Crinoids are echinoderms in the phylum Echinodermata, which also includes the starfish, brittle stars, sea ... class crinoidea. crinoids are in this class. characterized by a mouth on the top surface with feeding arms. class echinodea. are echinoids which include sea urchins, heart urchins, and sand dollarsThe topology from well-resolved trees of this early crinoid radiation indicates that the Crinoidea should be subdivided into six subclasses. A new subclass and new order, Aethocrinea and Aethocrinida, respectively, are proposed for crinoids with four circlets of plates in the aboral cup: lintels, infrabasals, basals, and radials.Feather stars are in the class Crinoidea, which is a group of echinoderms that includes sea lilies and feather stars. There are about 550 species of crinoid alive today, but crinoids have been around for a long time. They first appeared in the fossil record about 300 million years before the dinosaurs during the Middle Cambrian period.Phylum Echinodermata – Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) 1.
