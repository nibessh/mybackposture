But the best sword moves are dropped by bosses. Don't look it up, but if a boss uses a Katana generally they drop a skill. Drop rates can suck though.Onmyo magic builds can be valid as long as you confuse things (proc more than one elemental status ailment) with your shots and use extraction talismans to get living weapon often.
