[Reboot] Hello, I was just curious about why people do Von Leon these days. I thought it wasn't as rewarding as it requests somewhat lengthy pre-quest, but when I queue up for it I get matched with another person almost instantly everyday. I personally just do it for willpower from equipping the gear and possible cubes. <a href="keisha-grey-nude.html">chevy cruze p1101 code</a><a href="chromebook-recovery-mode.html">apostles creed ewtn</a> Von Leon is a great set, but pensalair allows transferring to CRA then Abso. And 12 stars at CRA is cheaper (imo) than 13 Stars von leon. I recommend Von Leon as well, but my point of the Epic Pensalair was to show how much relatively easier it is to get it vice Epic Von Leon. I was referring to the antique root gloves which require 3 Magnus coins.The set effect is reasonable and getting Noble Ifia's Ring is also a nice bonus. Pre-CRA has limited options on the weapons non-Pensalir/Muspell set, with the three contenders being Necromancer&gt;Von Leon/Empress. If you can get Empress set, it's great, but you might be struggling to do so, especially with solo progression.[NA-Scania] JimmyMiracleChapter0:00 Good Morning0:18 Ranged Heroes0:34 Ground Pound0:54 Lightning1:16 Teleporting1:45 Red Lasers2:22 Buffs2:50 Red Laser Dama...Steam Community: MapleStory.
