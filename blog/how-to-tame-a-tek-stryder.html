I beat the alpha overseer with 18 Theri, 2 Yuty, 1 Tek Rex, Theries had 22k hp 500-600 melee damage, 200 armor saddles, 20 cake each. Half of them died in the tek cave!‚á®Join my Discord: https://discord.gg/sixshadows ‚á®Become a Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/join/6shadows‚á®Twitter: https://twitter.com/sixshadows ‚á®Follow me o... </p><br/><ul class="links"></ul></div></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup><script data-cfasync="false" src="../cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script>
