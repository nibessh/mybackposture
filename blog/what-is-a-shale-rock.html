There are three kinds of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Igneous rocks form when molten rock (magma or lava) cools and solidifies. Sedimentary rocks originate when particles settle out of water or air, or by precipitation of minerals from water. They accumulate in layers.Shale Gas. A typical gas shale system is a blend of organic-rich deposition and complex mineralogy that forms a fine-grained clastic sedimentary rock with a unique geological framework where the shale independently exists as source, trap and reservoir.  "Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock that forms from the compaction of silt and clay-size mineral particles and is easily broken into thin, parallel layers. Black shale contains organic material that can generate oil and natural gas and trap the generated oil and natural gas within its pores.

Shale is the most common stone found in the sedimentary rock family. It makes up about 70% of the earth’s outer crust. Shale Rocks are commonly referred to as Claystone because they are composed of mud and clay sediments that have accumulated over a long period of time.  Oil shale, any sedimentary rock containing various amounts of solid organic material that yields petroleum products, along with a variety of solid by-products, when subjected to pyrolysis—a treatment that consists of heating the rock to above 300 °C (about 575 °F) in the absence of oxygen. Shale is a type of sedimentary rock, a rock formed either from the remains of organic creatures or from shattered pieces of older rocks. In shale’s case, layers of ancient silt and mud underwent extreme pressure that compounded them into thin sheets of striated rock. Shale is strong but brittle. It easily breaks into jagged shards. Shale is a sedimentary rock formed from clay and silt, while slate is a metamorphic rock formed from shale or clay. Shale has a layered structure and is rich in organic matter, while slate has a fissile texture and is highly compressed and durable. Shale is softer and less durable than slate, which makes it more prone to weathering and erosion ...Schist ( / ˈʃɪst / SHIST) is a medium-grained metamorphic rock showing pronounced schistosity.

A shale formation is a sedimentary rock composed of fine-grained detrital mineral (silt-size particles of quartz and calcite) and flakes of clay and it is characterised by the presence of about 1% to over 20% of Total Organic Carbon content (TOC). From: Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering, 2012. Location. Floor 1. There are three kinds of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Igneous rocks form when molten rock (magma or lava) cools and solidifies. Sedimentary rocks originate when particles settle out of water or air, or by precipitation of minerals from water. They accumulate in layers.Shale gas, which is often found with shale oil but is also produced on its own, is natural gas similarly trapped in tiny pockets diffused through the rock formation. Because the oil and gas are trapped in tight rock formations, these resources are sometimes referred to as tight oil and tight gas, names that would certainly help alleviate ...Slate is one stage in the metamorphosis of shale, a sedimentary rock, to gneiss, a metamorphic rock. Slate can also form from volcanic rock. In slate, the heated and compacted minerals slowly flow and align themselves perpendicular to the axis of compression, to create "cleavage," which is the tendency of the rock to break along straight lines.Siltstone is a sedimentary rock composed mainly of silt-sized particles. It forms where water, wind, or ice deposit silt, and the silt is then compacted and cemented into a rock. Silt accumulates in sedimentary basins throughout the world. It represents a level of current, wave, or wind energy between where sand and mud accumulate.Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock that forms from the compaction of silt and clay-size mineral particles that we commonly call "mud." This composition places shale in a category of sedimentary rocks known as " mudstones ."
