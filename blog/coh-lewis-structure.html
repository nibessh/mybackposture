Resonance is a mental exercise and method within the Valence Bond Theory of bonding that …. This problem has been solved! You'll get a detailed solution from a subject matter expert that helps you learn core concepts. See Answer. Question: Convert each condensed formula into line formula (NOT Lewis Structure): a. (CH3)3COH b. CH3CH2COOH c. CH3CONHCH3 d. (CH3)3CCHO. Convert each condensed formula into line formula (NOT Lewis Structure):Methylidyne radical. Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa). Methylidyne, or ( unsubstituted) carbyne, is an organic compound whose molecule consists of a single hydrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom. It is the parent compound of the carbynes, which can be seen as ... </p><br/><ul class="links"></ul></div></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup>
