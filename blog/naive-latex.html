Naive Bayes is a machine learning algorithm, but more specifically, it is a classification technique. This means that Naive Bayes is used when the output variable is discrete. The underlying mechanics of the algorithm are driven by the Bayes Theorem, which you’ll see in the next section. Naive Bayes is not a single algorithm, but a family of classification algorithms that share one common assumption: Every feature of the data being classified is independent of all other features given the class.

Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes that each parameter (also called features or predictors) has an independent capacity of predicting the output variable.Because of the class independence assumption, naive Bayes classifiers can quickly learn to use high dimensional features with limited training data compared to more sophisticated methods. This can be useful in situations where the dataset is small compared to the number of features, such as images or texts.Sudathesis-Bachelor-Template.
