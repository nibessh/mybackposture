Internal Reminders • Rehearsal: retelling yourself information you just learned, or restating it out loud in your own words. • Repetition:Chunking is the recoding of smaller units of information into larger, familiar units. Chunking is often assumed to help bypassing the limited capacity of working memory (WM). We investigate how chunks are used in WM tasks, addressing three questions: (a) Does chunking reduce the load on WM? Across four experiments chunking benefits were found ... 2. Methodology. The current theoretical article aimed to renew the debate about the concept of metamemory, redefine the role of metacognition in memory control processes, and highlight the importance of metacognitive strategies for developing metamemory skills with the assistance of virtual reality and mobile technology.The strategy instruction started with the experimenter explaining the rehearsal strategy. Then, participants trained the rehearsal strategy on the four stars and two stars tasks. For the four stars task, participants were asked to number the abstract pictures and repeat the number of the disappearing picture aloud to memorize the sequence.2. the repetition of information in an attempt to maintain it longer in memory. According to the dual-store model of memory, rehearsal occurs in short-term memory and may allow a stronger trace to then be stored in long-term memory. Although rehearsal implies a verbal process, it is hypothesized to occur in other modalities as well.How is Information Stored in Long-term Memory, I mentioned the importance of using elaborative rehearsal strategies to help transfer information into long term memory.

This may seem like an obvious one, but being intentional about repeating something will help it become encoded beyond your short-term memory. In the example of Bob and Cindy above, repeating their names in your head, along with the meaning you’ve given them, can help you recall those names later.  4 different training strategies that improve n-back level: Only 1 improves working memory capacity. There are four types of strategy training that are often used with dual n-back training. They can all improve n-back level performance. But only the first – rehearsal – is useful for expanding working memory capacity.  A common assumption in theories of working memory is that a maintenance process - broadly referred to as rehearsal - is involved in keeping novel information available. This review evaluates the effectiveness of three forms of rehearsal: articulatory rehearsal, attention-based refreshing, and elaborative rehearsal. Evidence for the effectiveness of these strategies is surprisingly weak ...Interestingly, chunking is one of several mnemonic strategies that have been studied in people with mild Alzheimer's disease. Results from these studies concluded that chunking can be helpful in improving verbal working memory in the early stages of dementia. 3.MEMORY-ENHANCING STRATEGIES What are some everyday ways we can improve our memory, including recall?

Regular physical exercise is a key lifestyle habit for a good memory. Cardiovascular exercise improves short-term memory and prevents deterioration of the hippocampus, the brain’s primary memory center. You don’t have to exercise for a long time, or strenuously, to reap these benefits.
