There are six electron groups around the central atom, each a bonding pair.Draw an acceptable Lewis structure from each condensed structure, such that all atoms have zero formal charge. a diethyl ether, (CH3CH2)2O, the first general anesthetic used in medical procedures b. acrylonitrile, CH2CHCN, starting material used to manufacture synthetic Orlon fibers c.dihydroxyacetone, (HOCH2)2CO, an ingredient in sunless ...In the Lewis structure of the chlorate ion, CIO", how many lone pairs of electrons does the chlorine atom have?. a. с. 2 b. d. 3 Expert Solution. Step by step Solved in 2 steps with 2 images. See solution. Check out a sample Q&amp;A here. Knowledge Booster. Learn more about Biological Importance of Chemical Elements.  VIDEO ANSWER: to draw an acceptable level of structure from its condensed structure. Such that all attempts have formal charges. So, first, the first general anesthetic used in the medical procedure. So dying in Ireland Die either. So what is theQuestion. Transcribed Image Text: Draw the Lewis structure of IF202 (with minimized formal charges) and then determine the ideal bonding angle (s) of the central atom. A) 109.5° B) 90° and 120° C) 120° D) 30° E) 135° Click to draw a new structure +.Steps. To properly draw the CH 3 CH 2 Cl Lewis structure, follow these steps: #1 Draw a rough sketch of the structure. #2 Next, indicate lone pairs on the atoms. #3 Indicate formal charges on the atoms, if necessary. Let's break down each step in more detail. </p><br/><ul class="links"></ul></div></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup>
