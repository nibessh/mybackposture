Today im giving away an Osmumten's Fang ( 30m osrs gp value )in thanks for 100 subs! all you have to do is comment on this video with your rsn &amp; subscribe to...Took my times from 4-5m to 1:50-2:30. its a pretty drastic improvement and makes grinding vorkath very feasible for ironmen pre lance. You can 5 tick woox walk by ctrl click running 3 tiles back, which takes two ticks, then 3 ticks to walk back. Its very easy and doesnt require weird sidesteps. Its good for melee gwd. While I dont necessarily disagree, to say entry mode has killed the price of the fang is disingenuous. Using the KC boards, if you assume invo 145 entry modes, 150 normal modes and 300 expert modes (best case scenario, highly unrealistic) and a similar team size across all 3, ~5% of fang drops come from Entry mode at most. Pretty decent method with the new Fang. It's heavy on supplies, but it's quite fast and not mind numbingly boring like the regular BGS method. Aproximate supplies per kill: 75 blood fury charges, 40 karambwans, 5 rings of recoil and some potion sips. Method: DWH spec corp. Regardless of whether they hit, slice the boss. Eat food.Examine. A long-dead pharaoh. Map. Advanced data. NPC ID. 11689,11690,11692,11693. Osmumten was the last pharaoh of the line of pharaohs chosen by Tumeken, the God of …Seen as Osmunten's Fang is a slow hitting, high accuracy, high damage weapon. I feel like it should look like a giant sabre-tooth's fang/mammoth's husk on a long stick/stave. 13. Ddaaggeerr1 • 9 mo. ago.yeah but you have to remember that the whip attacks faster than the fang, so against most enemies that aren't insanely tanky like dragons, the whip destroys enemies on slayer tasks because of the slayer helm accuracy. the fang obviously outperforms pretty much anything as you start to hit things with more than 80+ resists.Old School RuneScape General; Osmumten's fang nerf!

Posts: 5 Bronze Posts by user Forum Profile RuneMetrics Profile. You gone too far messing with weapons!Hello friends! Postie Pete here. Do you all remember that funny letter I received in last month's Postbag? Well, something even more unusual's gone on today!I tried this myself with and struggled a bit as an average PvMer. Was taking too much damage without an Ely. Also with the slower attack speed compared to Rapier you only have one tick to walk under to have the attacks be 2:1. With laggy worlds and only being an average player that was tough to accomplish. Did this as well in a duo, was getting ...From what I've been gathering, rapier is bis until higher level raids- then fang is bis. I believe Partisan may be bis with a coordinated spec but I'm unsure if the team would want rapiers or fangs. I saw a post earlier of a team doing a 1 round core with a Keris spec so the meta is still being fleshed out. Gotcha, well I guess we will find ...Rune dragons are some of the most durable monsters in game and as much as it's DHL's niche for hitting dragons, it's also Fang's niche to hit through defence. So it should be able to hit through defence. At non-dragon enemies. That weapon has a purpose across the entire game. The ONE NPC that the Lance is supposed to be the best at, its not the ...Tekton unsuccessfully tried to teach Xeric how to use the magic without the aid of the temple. Xeric later took him into the caves and gave him immortality by putting his soul in a new, indestructible body, enchanting his anvil and teaching him how to repair his new body. While he gained a large amount of power, Tekton soon noted he was unable ...It's about 5% with no hammers, going to 9% and 13% as hammers start landing. In CMs it's 3%, 5%, and 9%. So pretty significant, plus it's 4 tick. Also realized as I did these that I had the wrong target selected for the Vorkath calcs, the actual difference is closer to 6.6%. KodakKid3 • 7 mo. ago. If you can only afford one, definitely fang ...Comment by Old School Runescape staff, Mod_West: Mod Wolf dared me to make it as edgy as possible and damn did it pop off. ...

Mod Wolf dared me to make ...The fang is better against enemies with very high defense and the rapier is better as a generalist weapon. Because enemy stats scale with the number of invocations, it stands to reason there is a breakpoint somewhere that fang becomes better. 13. Elephantexploror • 1 yr. ago. Fang is better for high invocation, rapier is better for low ...At 300 Raid level rapier to fang is about a 15-20% upgrade at ba-ba and akkha, but a 25-30% increase from a hasta and more for a whip. Range calcs are a bit harder as there's a lot more diversity with armor/ weapons and etc. BOFA is generally better at all the below bosses than blowpipe or Armadyl crossbow.Anything higher than that, and Fang is better. Anything lower and Whip is better. But even against a 1 def enemy like Sand Crabs, the difference is about 10%, which is roughly equivalent to a d scim. So maybe whip for crab idling, but I think the fang would be appropriate for most regular monsters. 12.Quick question- after nerf, is the osmutens fang better than the whip for general slayer in terms of DPS? And if not, is it worth getting for a mid game iron? Wondering if it's even worth me learning the mechanics because this is the reward I'm looking for  I retested out the Osmumten's Fang at corp today. It's still good at the boss as I only landed 1 dwh spec and was still able to get a sub 6 minute kill. I ha...Apr 24, 2023 · The Osmumten's Fang Kit is the newest flex in OSRS.

It attacks normally every 4 ticks, but it can occasionally attack 3 ticks after its last. It will use a melee attack 40% of the time provided you are in melee range, The magic attacks are all equally common with a 20% incidence in melee range or a 33% incidence outside of melee range. Protect ...Even for the relatively low quality of graphics in osrs they managed to make the rapier actually look like a rapier and it is dope. This kerris looks thick af and the handle is just comically oversized.. i am sure they can come up with a better design.. maybe it looks better in game. It just looks like a gay addy long. (Because it isn't straight)You should be able to compensate for the price difference by coming using the fang. Unless you can’t make as much money, in which case buying the fang to begin with might not have been the best strategy. yourchickyacks • 7 mo. ago. Sometimes utility outweighs price losses. The great thing about a rapier though is that it's a liquid item. Once you are done grinding Slayer, you can sell it back and recoup your money +- small fluctuations in price. As a result , if you can afford it and you already have max melee (minus avernic), it's worth it if Slayer is your goal. 65m item vs 1b item.  0.6 kg. Advanced data. Item ID. 27219. The fang is an item that is dropped by Zebak in the Tombs of Amascut, in which the player receives one if they dealt the most damage to him. It is buried on the island with a spade in the middle of the River Elid (where players acquired the Lily of the Elid during Beneath Cursed Sands) after having spoken ...The Zamorakian hasta is made by taking a Zamorakian spear to Otto Godblessed, along with a payment of 300,000 coins (only 150,000 if the player has completed the Elite Kandarin Diary). It is the third most effective stab weapon behind the Ghrazi rapier and Osmumten's fang. Despite the examine text calling it a spear, the Zamorakian hasta does not deal full damage when fighting the Corporeal Beast.So I just recently got a fang, and using a DPS calculator I've found for me (~90 combat stats and pretty budget gear, fury, dragon boots, barrows gloves), the abyssal whip outperforms osmumten's fang on most tasks. The rule of thumb I tend to use is if the monster's defense is less than 120 or so, the whip hits enough that it's higher speed ...
