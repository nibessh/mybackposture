Sulfur tetrafluoride (SF 4) is a polar molecule.It is made up of four fluorine (F) atoms bonded to a sulfur (S) atom. Due to the electronegativity difference between S and F atoms, each S-F bond in the SF 4 molecule is polar.. The asymmetric, seesaw shape of the molecule further endorses bond polarity.100 views, 1 likes, 0 loves, 0 comments, 0 shares, Facebook Watch Videos from Geometry Of Molecules: Is XeF4 Polar or Non-polar? (Xenon Tetrafluoride) Xenon Tetrafluoride has a chemical formula of...  Answer = GaH3 ( Gallane ) is Nonpolar. What is polar and non-polar? Polar. "In chemistry, polarity is a separation of electric charge leading to a molecule or its chemical groups having an electric dipole or multipole moment. Polar molecules must contain polar bonds due to a difference in electronegativity between the bonded atoms.Draw the Lewis structure for XeO_4 and then decide if the molecule is polar or nonpolar. Draw the Lewis Structure, identify its geometry, and determine if the molecule is polar or nonpolar of the; Draw the Lewis structure for NO2-. Predict the electron geometry and molecular geometry and state whether it is polar or nonpolar.ClO4- is a chemical formula for perchlorate anion.
