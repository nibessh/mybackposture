I am not able to plot 2 signals against time on two different axes using the subplot command. Jul 5, 2016 · Thanks so much for taking time to answer the question. Your solution is a good one. However, in providing a generic example I neglected to indicate that my 'small' subplot uses a special subplot (one from the FEX that removes spacing between plots) and I was rather hoping to keep that formatting while still using the normal subplot for the 'big' subplot. But I want the third subplot (temperature) to use the jet colormap. When I run the full script for my figure I get jet coloring for all three. But if I only run the first subplots I get the coloring I want. Is there something in my code for the third subplot that is changing the first two? Please see figures for clarification.
