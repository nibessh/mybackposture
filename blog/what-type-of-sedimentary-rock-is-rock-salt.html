Conglomerate-Composed of variable size of grain, ranging from peeble/gravel to sand size. Evaporites-Accumulation of salt or mineral as sediment after evaporation Sedimentary rock is classified into two main categories: clastic and chemical. Clastic or detrital sedimentary rocks are made from pieces of bedrock, sediment, derived primarily by mechanical weathering. Clastic rocks may also include chemically weathered sediment. Clastic rocks are classified by grain shape, grain size, and sorting. These types of sedimentary rocks usually occur in arid areas, like gypsum and salt deposits. Examples of chemical sedimentary rocks are chert, dolomites, flint, rock salt, iron ore, and some types of limestone. 2. Clastic. Clastic sedimentary rocks occur when there is a buildup of tiny pieces of broken rocks (clastic).Sedimentary rocks are one of the three main types of rocks, alongside igneous and metamorphic rocks. These rocks are made from tiny particles of rocks, minerals, and even organic material like plants and shells. Over millions of years, these particles, known as sediment, are pressed together and become solid rock.What is Rock Salt? Most of the salt we use in cooking, both table salt and Kosher salt, is made by flooding underground salt deposits with freshwater, extracting the water and then evaporating it to leave the pure salt crystals behind. A smaller proportion, which is known as sea salt, is produced by evaporating the salt from seawater.There are three main types of rocks: sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic.
