The decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, which means that each step up or down the scale is a 10x increase or decrease in amplitude. This is the scale that is used to measure the intensity of sound. 0 dB is the threshold of human hearing, which is the softest sound that a person can hear.The human ear has a standard sound threshold of 120 dB, which expressed logarithmically is around 1012. This is a standard threshold, but it also depends on frequency. Loudness is a measure of sound intensity taking frequency into account, and is called a A-weighted decibel, dB(A), or a phon.The human ear has a standard sound threshold of 120 dB, which expressed logarithmically is around 1012. This is a standard threshold, but it also depends on frequency. Loudness is a measure of sound intensity taking frequency into account, and is called a A-weighted decibel, dB(A), or a phon. Sound pressure level (SPL) measurements will tell us a lot about the strength of the sound waves. SPL can be measured linearly in Pascal (SI unit) or in pounds-per-square-inch (imperial unit). However, SPL is more often measured in dB SPL. That is decibels of sound pressure relative to the threshold of human hearing (20 x 10-6 Pa or 20 µPa).Noise level is measured in decibels (dB). The louder the noise, the higher the decibels. Noise level is thus described in decibels A (dBA). The effects of noise vary with the noise to which a person is exposed. Prolonged exposure to loud noises (75 dBA over eight hours a day for years) can lead to hearing loss.The PCE-MSL 1 decibel meter is used to quickly determine the ambient noise level.
