MadZuri's circuit train unloader is great for belt-based unloading because it balances the chests and thus the outbound belts. The bots aren't constrained by belt throughput, so if the chests are uneven, it doesn't matter.Start a game from the beginning one more time and name it "start here" ans play up until you get to bots. Then whenever you want to "start" a new game you load up your "start here" save and play from that point saving the progress in that "new" game in a different save slot. This is what I do too.Green Circuits to Copper Cable is 2:3, not 1:3. I like to use a main bus design so that I can make any number of products, and draw on vast amounts of production of intermediate products.

Outputting the blues on to the same belt as reds is clever, but if your reds ever back up you have no room for blue output. Blue output is always open. Reds won't block that halfbelt.Production speed is increased mostly by beacons rather than more machines. In it's final form, it cranks out a bit over 10 blue circuits/second. Processsing units should never be made without at least prod 1 modules inside the assembler.

It will just be normal ground otherwise. Copper loads from the North and Steel from the South while the circuits feed out to the West. My little rocket fuel train stop sits to the east. The green circuit factories are set up at a 13:14 ratio, per row.  Edit: I tested out two 1:2 designs, one with extra beacons in between the plants and one without. The extra beacons get 635/m output for 32 modules, without it is 517 for 24. Computing output/module: 1:2 boosted gives 635 / 32 = 19.8 cpm/module. 1:2 normal gives 517 / 24 = 21.5 cpm/module.

Factorio Giveaway - 48 hour post - Cleared with Moderators.Mar 20, 2016 · 1) the design is more narrow, 17 tiles instead of 22. But it is quite higher (15 instead of 9). And you can make it even more narrow, for the price of two more underground belts (i.e. 15 tiles wide and 15 tiles high). 2) it takes more underground belts. 8 instead of zero. 3) It takes less iron power poles (4 instead of 5). every cycle (0.5s/1.25) you are producing 14x2= 28 cables cables but you need 12*3 = 36 cables to sustain the electronic circuits factories. The perfect optimal ratio is 3 cables factories for 2 electronic circuit factories. A blue belt moves 40 items / seconds. A single copper cable factories needs 1*1.25/0.5 = 2.5 copper plate /s.(1) Default capacity is 1 item per robot. This can be increased by researching Worker robot cargo size (research).

Here's for the recipe on normal mode: 6 x time + 1 x inserter + 1 x transport bell = 1 x logistic science pack. With the total raw of: 8.75 (time) + 1.5 (copper plate) + 5.5 (iron plate) It results in a stack size of 200 and is produced by Assembling ...Find blueprints for the video game Factorio.

This blueprint is part of the "Base-in-a-Book" Tutorial series by Nilaus: https://goo.gl/rGdWWV. Copy to Clipboard Show Blueprint Show Json. Extra Info. Book:That the green circuit assemblers are outputting 40% more doesn't really affect ratios unless they are also feeding directly into something else. Without productivity you need 1 iron and 1½ copper for a green circuit. With productivity bonus in both assemblers you only need 0.714 Iron and 0.765 Copper.Yet another green cells build :) by LazyLoneLion » Mon Mar 21, 2016 12:36 am. I was experimenting with builds of green cells production. Just for the sake of it. Keep in mind, that I'm kind of new to Factorio. Everyone knows standard build, AKA "3 to 2", like here: factorio 2016-03-21 01-29-39-9.jpg.I've got a few issues with Red/Green Wires ("wires," not Copper "Cables"). The first is the cost-then-loss problem. There are so many other things that I wish could be destroyed so easily - like wood. But no. Wires, which cost a circuit-board and some copper (both highly-valued much more than wood) just simply vanish when you cut them. One miss-click - poof!This is what I know: - Use 3 copper wire assemblers for every 2 GC assemblers, to get a proper ratio. Repeat enough times to saturate your output belts. - Feed it 1 belt of Iron, 1.5 belts of copper and you will produce 2 belts of Green Circuits.Factorio Red Green Blue Circuit 40, 40, 36 /min.

Search the tags for mining, smelting, and advanced production blueprints.With four "productivity 3" modules in all the assemblers you produce 40% more wire, so it becomes "2 / 0.5 * speed * 1.4" wire per second per assembler and still consume "4 / 6 * speed" wire per second per assembler, where the "speed" still cancels, giving you a 5.6:0.6666 ratio or an 8.4:1 ratio or an 42:5 ratio.Go to factorio r/factorio • ... In expensive mode, the ratio is 5 wire to 1 green circuit. In this blueprint the green circuit assemblers are starved a little because they are 8 and 6 beacons each and the wire assemblers are I think 7 to 9 beacons each. But it's enough for a full belt and I couldn't find a way to make it even denser than this.First stage of a full belt split off. Remember to re-balance the Main Bus lines. (Read the Re-balance section that follows.) If you are pulling from a middle lane in the bus, make sure to use undergrounds to allow the rest of the products on their way. Pulling from a single belt in the middle of a 4 belt group.UFDC Image Array 2The Smelter V3.0. this is my blueprint book for all types of smelting.

So that's 20 copper cable and 20 green circuit machines. That's for a full blue line for both copper and iron I think. I didn't do super accurate calculations for this haha.

Green circuits in mid-game with red belts.Take a step back and think about the vanilla recipe for green circuits. They're made of just iron and copper, both electrically conductive materials that would short any circuit you made out of them. An important part of any circuit are the insulators, resistors, semiconductors, etc. Wood or stone make a much better circuit boards than iron.Factorio Blueprint book with all blueprints from Nilaus's Master Class series Posted by anonymous 2 years ago Masterclass by Nilaus - Master book Green/Red/Blue Circuit …Factorio Prints.
