Three of my favorites there are Nordstrom Rack, Aeropostale, and Target. I don't think any of the other malls have those three. Outdoor mall (most malls in San Diego are) with standard stores, movie theater, and restaurants."My understanding is that all gas in San Diego comes from the same place, just north of Friars next to I-15.
