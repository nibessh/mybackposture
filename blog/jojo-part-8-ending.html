Most Americans are aware that Medicare provides healthcare for citizens once they turn 65 as well as younger people with certain disabilities and end-stage renal disease. However, how to actually collect those benefits is a different story.Yes. I'd say all Jojo parts are at least and 8 and a 7 if you really don't like part 1. Besides it, part 7 might be a 10 as well as 3. The middle of the part is top tier Jojo content and the rest is fun, the ending can be somewhat of a disappointment given how great the middle act was, but otherwise a great part.Part 7 Universe has NOTHING to do with Part 6's ending. Agree and disagree with that. Araki introduces the concept of a multiverse to Jojo, and then jumps to a totally different universe. It's kinda related, it's just not the same universe. Without part 6 ending like that, though, we definitely wouldn't have part 7 or 8 as they are now.

The part won the Grand Prize for manga at the 2013 Japan Media Arts Festival . [1]Part 2: Okay, so this and Part 3 im not sure on entirely. I think the anime part 2 ending is better, but in the manga Part 3 wins. Im gonna go with my gut here and say that the ending of JoJo's first season was amazing. Its kinda unlike any other JoJo ending, with Joseph basically powerless to beat Kars and him winning out of blind luck.Immortal_Dude • 2 yr. ago. If you guys think Araki is going to do a part 9 then you have 't been paying attention to part 8. "Jojolion" literally means the celebration of JoJo. Also he is getting too old, expecting a 9th part from him is incredibly selfish. </p><br/><ul class="links"></ul></div></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup>
