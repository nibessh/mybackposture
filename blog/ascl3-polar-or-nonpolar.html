The bond may result from the electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions as in ...May 25, 2023 · As all the three bonds (Al-Cl) are symmetrical and the AlCl3 molecule has a symmetrical geometry, their bond polarity gets canceled with each other. Because of this, there are no positive and negative poles of charges on the overall molecule of AlCl3. Hence, the AlCl3 molecule is a nonpolar molecule. I hope you have understood the reason behind ... Answer: NH4NO2 is an ionic bond. What is chemical bond, ionic bond, covalent bond? Chemical bond. A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms, ions or molecules that enables the formation of chemical compounds.
