However ...  How much is a Redbox late fee per day? While there are no late fees for exceeding the rental period, you still have to pay the regular fee for each additional day. Therefore, if you rent a DVD for a day and keep it for another four days, the rental payment due will be $8.75 plus tax if applicable.With Redbox On Demand, you can stream older, catalog titles for $2, and new releases start at $4 for a 48-hour viewing window. You can buy movies for $10 and up. Those prices are lower than what ...0.007% x $10,000 = $0.79 per day. 90 days x $0.79 per day = $71.52. Seventy bucks might not sound like a lot. But imagine if that invoice is $50, $100, or $250,000. The more money you have on the table, the more expensive time gets. So, time costs money in the form of inflation. But that's just one of the costs. </p><br/><ul class="links"></ul></div></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup><script data-cfasync="false" src="../cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script>
