When implementing a DRO in ABA, teaching replacement behavior ...7 Common ABA Data Collection Methods. 1. Frequency/Event &amp; Rate Recording. The frequency/event and rate recording method involves counting and recording the number of times a behavior happens within a specific time frame. This can be how many times a child bangs their fist against the desk or how many times a student bites their pencil eraser.Instances of a response occur repeatedly through time. 3- Types of repeatability measures: 1.Count (add up the bx's or items) 2. Rate (AKA frequency) 3. Celeration/Frequency (Count per unit of time) *This is the same thing as frequency. Temporal Extent. When the DURATION of the behavior can be measured. Trend, Level, Variability. Behavior analysts must possess the ability to analyze data. It is one of the most important skills because we rely so heavily on data to guide our interventions. Visual analysis is the mechanism by which we convert graphs to decisions. Visual analysis is the practice of interpreting graphs by simply looking at them.May 17, 2017 · Abstract.

Latency recording measures the amount of time that lapses between an antecedent (e.g., teacher’s directive) and when the student begins to perform a specified behavior. This type of data collection is appropriate for behaviors that follow a command or directive, or a distinct stimulus.  Latency recording is a preferred measurement procedure when information about a behavior’s latency is the dimension of interest. For example, Call et al. ( 2009 ) evaluated the mean latency to problem behavior during different tasks as an index of each task’s aversive properties (i.e., tasks associated with low latencies were aversive).Have a clearly defined onset (what identifies as the START of the behavior) and offset (what defined the END of the behavior).; Make sure staff are trained to identify start and stop and have a good way to measure it (e.g., clipboard with behavior definition and data sheet, stopwatch or other way to measure time).; Observe and track the time of the behaviors.Frequency.
