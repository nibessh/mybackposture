I agree, it is better to just avoid them if you can,use the Seamoth Perimeter Defense System, and don't park your Seamoth in Reaper territory. But... since tere are so many Reapers out there now, and they are spawning or migrating to areas that they never used to (like Reapers in the center of the safe Shallows...), that is a bit easier said than …Hello everyone. I don't own the game but I really like to watch how my friend plays it and planing to get it as well if devs will make co-op. So, me and my friend discussed about Perimeter Defense System upgrade and would be cool if devs made Perimeter Defense System Upgrade MK2. It could work the same way but it will trigger automatically when player isn't in Seamoth and someone is damaging it.Use the d-pad to select it at the bottom of the UI while in the seamoth, like you would a regular tool. Then tap or hold and release A depending on what kind of message you want to send to the terrors of the deep. 13. ElephantYarnBall • 4 yr. ago.
