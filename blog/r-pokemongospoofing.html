I don‚Äôt mind rooting do you have a good or accurate guide I can follow. 1. gurg2k1 ‚Ä¢ 4 yr. ago. Check XDA for rooting your model if the instructions here dont work then come back and follow the spoofing related instructions. 1.  short answer - yes, it's free, but the UI sucks. long answer.... first off, there is no such thing as risk-free spoofing.

For iOS you will either want to jailbreak using the correct jailbreak, 1 of the iTools hardware devices, or following the rule for using the tethered bot method of closing out the game before changing the location i.e no walking around in the game. For Android the safest is as I mentioned to use a rooted Android the native app, and then nothing ...Yes the new method launched in June/July is still up and running, as I saw where someone yesterday using PoGo was caught.

Niantic made it clear that their new measure is to be an ongoing deal. u/Stidda said it's still dangerous and has always been risky to do, and regardless of the ... PC/MAC tethered GPS overriders are the next safest - 3uTools (IOS), iMyFone AnyTo (IOS/Andriod), Tenorshare iAnyGo (IOS), Drfone Virutal Location (IOS/Andriod), UnicTool TailorGo (IOS/Andriod) and iToolsPC (IOS). 3uTools is free, but i personally don't like it's interface. I prefer AnyTo. Do not walk or joystick around in the game - using the ...There have not been any strikes in the past several months so some spoofers have been lured into using this method but it's not feasible to spoof long term with this method. It always eventually gets detected. If you can jailbreak that's a safe route but requires IOS 13 or 14. Otherwise get an iTools Bluetooth device.In actuality it's the method you use to spoof, you can teleport from Japan to California in the same minute and have no consequences aside from having to wait 2 hours for the action cooldown. I'd recommend SX if you're on iOS, but similarly to android (rooting), to safely spoof you want to Jailbreak your iPhone. best place for raids?

The only option that's so far been shown to be the safest to use, and is free, is with a jailbreak and S X. Anything that's an altered variant of the game, isn't safe, and it may only be a matter of days to not much more than about 2 months before they start getting smacked again. Which has happened 3 times this year.  Short answer is: No. There are too many different devices that need different bits of code that are specific to just those devices. You will need to search on XDA for your exact model of device and research how to do that on your own. There‚Äôs just too many variables involved otherwise.The safest way is to root the device if possible, and stay clear of ay addons, such as Po ke Mo d. While Po ke Mo d may at this moment seem safe, there's no telling when Niantic will find away to catch people using it. Now as to whether or not you can root that phone is another matter altogether. There are some variables at play, such as who it ...UPDATE: Google or Niantic appear to be clamping down on this. Pakistan no longer works same as Turkey.
