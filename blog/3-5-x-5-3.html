Then we're asked to find the intercepts of the corresponding graph. The key is realizing that the x -intercept is the point where y = 0 , and the y -intercept is where x = 0 . The point ( 7, 0) is our x -intercept because when y = 0 , we're on the x -axis.Solution: (i) In a throw of die, list of the outcomes of an event of getting (a) a prime number are 2, 3 and 5.
