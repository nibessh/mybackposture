Table 8.2 Helpful Memory Techniques Based on Psychological Research. Technique. Description. Useful example. Use elaborative encoding. Material is better remembered if it is processed more fully. Jun 16, 2023 · The levels of processing model (Craik &amp; Lockhart, 1972) focuses on the depth of processing involved in memory, and predicts the deeper information is processed, the longer a memory trace will last. Craik defined depth as: “the meaningfulness extracted from the stimulus rather than in terms of the number of analyses performed upon it.” (1973, p.  memory. Elaboration logically entails attending to the words, either in memory or in the environment. When elaboration is applied to words just encoded into working memory, but no longer presented, it entails refreshing, whereas when elaboration is applied to words while they are presented, it entails (re-)reading, as in the repeat con-dition.

The purpose of this article is to describe a recent instructional effort, referred to as the Elaboration Theory of Instruction (ETI), and chart its correspondence with several major ...Elaborative encoding is both semantic and echoic. Semantic encoding has to do with the structure, and oftentimes, meaning of information. For example, in learning the letters of the alphabet, you probably didn’t start with the letter Q. Instead, you learned your A, B, Cs through song, in alphabetical order (a structure).Interference is a memory phenomenon in which some memories interfere with the retrieval of other memories. Essentially, interference occurs when some information makes it difficult to recall similar material. Similar memories compete, causing some to be more difficult to remember or even forgotten entirely.Jun 1, 2023 · Elaborative encoding is both semantic and echoic.

Scientists used to think that brain connections developed at a rapid pace in the first few years of life, until you reached your mental peak in your early 20s. Your cognitive abilities would level off at around middle age, and then start to gradually decline. We now know this is not true.For example, identifying the category to which the stimulus belongs (dog–animal; freezer–object found in the kitchen) or establishing relationships with past events (associating “freezer” with the memory of the freezer in one's home) are elaboration strategies that facilitate the recall of these words because they enrich the stimulus to ...Working memory affects false memory production for emotional events.
