A spatial resolution of 85 nm, about one-ninth of the laser wavelength at 780 nm, has been realized by using commercial positive AZ P4620 photoresist. The infrared small-dim target detection is one of the key techniques in the infrared search and tracking system. Since the local regions similar to infrared small-dim targets spread over the whole background, exploring the interaction information amongst image features in large-range dependencies to mine the difference between the target and background is crucial for robust detection.
