ExamplesHas been discussed that the way to find the column datatype in pyspark is using df.dtypes get datatype of column using pyspark. The problem with this is that for datatypes like an array or struct you get something like array&lt;string&gt; or array&lt;integer&gt;. Question: Is there a native way to get the pyspark data type? Like ArrayType(StringType,true)For verifying the column type we are using dtypes function. The dtypes function is used to return the list of tuples that contain the Name of the column and column type. Syntax: df.dtypes () where, df is the Dataframe.

I have tried to use: test_df.filter(array_contains(test_df.a, None))In the previous article on Higher-Order Functions, we described three complex data types: arrays, maps, and structs and focused on arrays in particular. In this follow-up article, we will take a look at structs and see two important functions for transforming nested data that were released in Spark 3.1.1 version.Filtering values from an ArrayType column and filtering DataFrame rows are completely different operations of course. The pyspark.sql.DataFrame#filter method and the pyspark.sql.functions#filter function share the same name, but have different functionality. One removes elements from an array and the other removes rows from a DataFrame.I have an Apache Spark dataframe with a set of computed columns.
