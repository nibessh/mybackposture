Penicillin Streptomycin solution is used to maintain sterile conditions during cell culture, and they show few adverse effects on the cultured cells. These findings suggest that the synergism of penicillin with streptomycin depends on the damaging effect of penicillin on the cell membrane, which promotes further damage by …Penicillin is a medication used to manage and treat a wide range of infections. It is in the beta-lactam antibiotic class of drugs. This activity describes penicillin's indications, action, and contraindications as a valuable agent in treating infection. In addition, this activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing ...penicillin and streptomycin, account for half the sales of all drugs.
