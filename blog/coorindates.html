Sep 10, 2023 ¬∑ Thus, cylindrical coordinates are very similar to the polar coordinate system introduced in two dimensions, except with the addition of the \(z\) coordinate. Cylindrical coordinates are useful for describing situations with azimuthal symmetry, such as the motion along the surface of a cylinder. For example, consider point \(P\) in Figure A1.1.6. The three coordinates are (in this order) X, Y, and Z. "X" is your longitude. If X is positive, you're to the east of your starting block. If X is negative, you're to the west. "Y" is your elevation. 63 is sea level, and 0 is bedrock. "Z" is your latitude. If Z is positive, you're south of the starting block.Find Google Maps coordinates - fast and easy!
