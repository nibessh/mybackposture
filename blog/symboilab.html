An arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is always the same, and often written in the form: a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ..., where a is the first term of the series and d is the common difference. What is a geometic series?The perfect square rule is a technique used to expand expressions that are the sum or difference of two squares, such as (a + b)^2 or (a - b)^2. The rule states that the square of the sum (or difference) of two terms is equal to the sum (or difference) of the squares of the terms plus twice the product of the terms.
