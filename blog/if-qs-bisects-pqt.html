Click here 👆 to get an answer to your question ️ If Ray QS bisects angle PQT, measure angle SQT = (8x-25), measure angle PQT= (9x+34), and measure angle SQR=…1 answer Since QS−→ bisects ∠PQT, we can set ∡SQT equal to ∡PQT. Therefore, we have: 8x - 25 = 9x + 34 Subtracting 8x from both sides: -25 = x + 34 Subtracting 34 from both sides: -59 = x Therefore, the measure of ∠PQT is: 9x + 34 = 9 (-59) + 34 = -531 + 34 = -497 degreesGiven: PQ bisects ∠ P Q R, A B ⊥ B Q, A C ...
