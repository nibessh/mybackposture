The test statistic is a Student's t because the sample size is below 30; therefore, we cannot use the normal distribution. Comparing the calculated value of the test statistic and the critical value of t t (t a) (t a) at a 5% significance level, we see that the calculated value is in the tail of the distribution. Thus, we conclude that 108 ...When we do so, the z-score for our sample mean is. zX¯ = X¯−μ0 SE(X¯) z X ¯ = X ¯ − μ 0 S E ( X ¯) or, equivalently. zX¯ = X¯−μ0 σ/ N√ z X ¯ = X ¯ − μ 0 σ / N. This z-score is our test statistic. The nice thing about using this as our test statistic is that like all z-scores, it has a standard normal distribution:We will perform the one sample t-test with the following hypotheses: Step 3: Calculate the test statistic t. Step 4: Calculate the p-value of the test statistic t. According to the T Score to P Value Calculator, the p-value associated with t = -3.4817 and degrees of freedom = n-1 = 40-1 = 39 is 0.00149.This is how you can understand and solve the statistics math problems in an easy manner.
