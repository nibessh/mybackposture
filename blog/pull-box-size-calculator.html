Figuring the 20% is easy, for example.When determining the minimum size box for conductors 18 through 6 AWG, the sizes and numbers of conductors are needed to calculate the minimum size box. The sizes and …Make math easy with our online calculator and conversion site. All of our tools covering finance, education, health, cooking, and more are free to use! Our easy to use calculators deliver fast, reliable results on any device.  Last, we input the data in the breaker size calculator (or in the respective equation if we're solving manually) using the advanced mode of the calculator. The calculator will output the microwave's load on the circuit 6.04 A 6.04 \ \text{A} 6.04 A and the closest standard breaker size suitable for that load 15 A 15 \ \text{A} 15 A.The first step for sizing boxes containing cables is to convert each cable size into a raceway size. To transpose cable size into raceway size, simply find the minimum trade …Step 3: Select your weld preparation (all variables are mandatories to proceed the calculation) Th - Sheet thickness (mm) Steel density.
