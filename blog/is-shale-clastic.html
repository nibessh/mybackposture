Conclusion Sedimentary rock is classified into two main categories: clastic and chemical. Clastic or detrital sedimentary rocks are made from pieces of bedrock, sediment, derived primarily by mechanical weathering. Clastic rocks may also include chemically weathered sediment. Clastic rocks are classified by grain shape, grain size, and sorting.  oil shale, any sedimentary rock containing various amounts of solid organic material that yields petroleum products, along with a variety of solid by-products, when subjected to pyrolysis—a treatment that consists of …Fine-Grained Clastic Rocks. Rock composed of at least 75% silt- and clay-sized clasts is called mudrock (Figure 9.5, bottom row). If a mudrock shows evidence of fine layers (laminations) and breaks into sheets, it is called shale. Otherwise, it is siltstone (dominated by silt), mudstone (a mix of silt and clay), or claystone (dominated by clay).  9.1.2.3 Fine-Grained Clastic Rocks.

[1]Shale. Our final clastic rock type is the most common type of all five: shale rocks. These rocks are the thinnest type and are identified as sedimentary rocks that have been laminated and composed of fine-grained materials. Like many of the other types, quartz is a common element in shale rocks. AAPG Store. The Appalachian Basin has been an important shale-gas-producing province since the early 1800s, with an estimated 3.0 tcf already produced from Devonian black shale. [1] Until recently, the organic-rich Marcellus Shale, although recognized as a major source rock, was not a significant hydrocarbon producer in the Appalachian Basin.Common sedimentary rocks include sandstone, limestone, and shale. These rocks often start as sediments carried in rivers and deposited in lakes and oceans. When buried, the sediments lose water and become cemented to form rock. Tuffaceous sandstones contain volcanic ash. Clastic Sedimentary Rocks:The characteristics and distinguishing features of clastic sedimentary rocks are summarized in Table 6.2. Mudrock is composed of at least 75% silt- and clay-sized fragments. If it is dominated by clay, it is called claystone.
