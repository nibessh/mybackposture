When initially released, the Archer Queen cost 40.000 dark elixirs to summon. It was later reduced to 20.000 in the March 2020 update and 10.000 in the April 2021 update. The Archer Queen is the only hero to appear barefoot in her default skin.Apr 11, 2021‚ÄÇ¬∑‚ÄÇInferno Dragon level 2 DPS has been decreased from 80-1600 to 79-1580 and HP reduced by 50. Inferno Dragon beam cooldown time has been increased from 0.5s to 0.6s. Increase max Spell donation count by 1 for Clans of Level 4 and above. Level 8 Inferno Tower will have 6 beams while in Multi-Inferno mode.Update idea: If you clear a capital base with less than 10% health left, you get 1000 bonus capital gold. In our clan, these 90%+ bases take ages to get cleared. 928. 82. r/ClashOfClans.
