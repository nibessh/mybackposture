It will only point out possible edits and advise you on changes you need to make. You have full autonomy and can decide which changes to accept. 4. Get support for every stage of your story. Writing can get lonely. But, with ProWritingAid, you can get support from first draft to publication. Along with 20+ in-app writing-improvement reports, you’ll always have access to a free community of fellow writers.  Whether you are writing for a living or just writing a grocery list, these free apps for writers will help you complete your project with ease. Contents: 1. ProWritingAid. 2.
