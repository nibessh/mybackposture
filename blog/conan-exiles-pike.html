I choose daggers against some monsters, a spear against some others, axes or two-handed swords against crowds, etc.Steam Community: Conan Exiles. Here is my list of top ten best weapons. SPEARS: 1.

And their magicians made a terrible magic to guard the city; for by their necromantic arts they re-created the dragons which had once dwelt in this lost land, and whose monstrous bones they found in the forest. Those bones they clothed in flesh and life, and the living beasts walked the earth as they walked it when time was young.There is no info on wiki about the humors being obtainable through the library. Oh, right, sorry got those 2 mixed up. They drop from ghouls on Siptah. You can farm them pretty reliably if you get a bunch of ghoul statues and take them to the pool of the Grey ones.How to get a horse. Foal spawns seem to be rare. In the Exiled Lands, foals spawn in G9/10, somewhere in or near C10, and the large island in K5/6. If you prefer rhino mounts, I know there are some rhino calves in G7, around the little watering hole there. On the Isle of Siptah, its G9/10 and J8/9.

Ofc not, but that's how it is right now. If you're a strength build, for stats I'd suggest something like 20 strength, 0 agility, 20 vitality, 0 authority, 10 grit, 10 expertise. High damage,.high health, good Stam, good carry weight.Aug 23, 2021 · There's a lot of really good PvE options. None of them are the best in all circumstances. I'd say the only ones to avoid would be spear, one hand mace, and the new greataxe. Everything else has strong use cases. Best all-round would probably be axe+shield and greatsword. #8.
